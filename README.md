*xcdiff* is an extensible tool that **finds differences between two .xcodeproj project files**. It can be thought of as git diff for .xcodeproj files, which can be used directly from the command line as well as a library supporting your own set of tools.

## How to use xcdiff

Running the command `xcdiff` in your project directory will search for two `.xcodeproj` files in this directory and use all of xcdiff's comparators on the projects (e.g. targets, sources and headers).

You can also specify two particular projects for xcdiff to compare.

```sh
xcdiff -p1 OriginalProject.xcodeproj -p2 GeneratedProject.xcodeproj
```

Here is an example output:

To see a detailed report of differences you can specify the `--verbose` (`-v`) option.

```sh
xcdiff -p1 OriginalProject.xcodeproj -p2 GeneratedProject.xcodeproj -v
```

</p>

## Use Cases

- When adopting project generation (e.g. using tools like [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) or [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist)), comparing the generated xcodeproj files against the original ones can help boost confidence in the migration process.
- _Probably a few more we haven't thought of yet!..._

## Installation

- [Install xcdiff](Documentation/Installation.md#CLI) and use from the command line.
- [Add as a dependency](Documentation/Installation.md#Framework) of your macOS project (xcdiff follows the [semantic versioning][3]).

## Documentation

- Read [xcdiff CLI](Documentation/CLI.md) documentation or try `xcdiff --help`.
- Check out how to use [XCDiffCore Framework](Documentation/Framework.md) in your own project.
